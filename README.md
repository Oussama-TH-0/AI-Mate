# AI Study Mate - Smart Study Assistant

Welcome to **AI Study Mate**, an intelligent assistant designed to answer lecture questions specifically for Informatics Engineering students at Aleppo University. This project leverages state-of-the-art AI models including Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) and the BAAI/bge-m3 embedding model to provide accurate and context-aware answers based on uploaded PDF documents.

Features include the ability to upload clear, readable PDF files which are split into smaller chunks for effective retrieval. It uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for advanced language generation, maintains conversational context by remembering the last 3 question-answer pairs, supports questions in Arabic and English answering in the same language and style, and detects reference questions related to previous conversation turns.

The friendly and easy-to-use interface is built with Gradio and includes helpful tips to improve user experience.

## Installation & Running the Project

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
!pip install -q gradio pymupdf langchain langchain-community langchain-huggingface langchain-google-genai faiss-cpu
```

After installation, launch the app by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will open a web interface where you can upload PDFs, ask questions in Arabic or English related to the documents, and get accurate, context-aware answers generated by the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model.

The app uses FAISS with BAAI/bge-m3 embeddings for fast and relevant document retrieval.

## How It Works

- **PDF Processing:** The app reads and splits PDFs using PyMuPDF and a recursive text splitter.
- **Embedding & Indexing:** Text chunks are embedded with BAAI/bge-m3 model and indexed using FAISS.
- **Answering:** Questions trigger a search for relevant text chunks; context and conversation history are sent to Google Gemini for answer generation.
- **Context Maintenance:** The app remembers the last three Q&A pairs for coherent follow-up answers.

Feel free to contribute or report issues!
